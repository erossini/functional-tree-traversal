functional-tree-traversal
=========================

This soluton Implements a method with WebAPI 2.2 to receive a POST request with the following properties:
•Age (int)
•Name (string)

Save these in a database as a binary tree, keyed by age, and expose an HTTP endpoint to query the tree by a persons name and age. The query should run a tree traversal algorithm to find the correct node in the tree. The code to query the tree should be written in a functional manner.
